# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Root Page**: Created `src/app/page.tsx` to serve as the main entry point
2. **Turbopack Build Issue**: Removed `--turbopack` from production build script
3. **Navigation Import**: Updated to use the correct Navigation component
4. **Vercel Configuration**: Added `vercel.json` for proper deployment settings
5. **Route Group Conflict**: Removed conflicting `(main)` route group that caused build errors

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created `src/app/page.tsx` - Root page for Vercel deployment
- ✅ Updated `package.json` - Removed turbopack from build script
- ✅ Created `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- ✅ Updated Navigation imports to use correct component
- ✅ Removed `src/app/(main)/` - Eliminated route group conflicts

## Build Error Fixed

**Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/.next/server/app/(main)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'`

**Solution**: Removed the conflicting `(main)` route group directory that was causing Vercel to look for non-existent manifest files.

## Deployment Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub repository
2. Vercel will automatically deploy using the new configuration
3. The site should now load properly at https://feelthe-frame.vercel.app/

## Local Testing

- ✅ `pnpm dev` - Development server works
- ✅ `pnpm build` - Production build successful (no errors)
- ✅ All routes and navigation functional
- ✅ No route group conflicts
